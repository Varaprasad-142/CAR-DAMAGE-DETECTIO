# 🚗 Vehicle Damage Detection and Cost Estimation

This project provides a deep learning-based solution for **automatic detection** of vehicle damage from images and **prediction of repair cost**. It is designed to help insurance companies, repair shops, and car rental services to quickly assess vehicle damage severity and provide cost estimates.

## 📌 Features

- ✅ Detects damaged regions of vehicles using YOLOv5
- 📸 Takes a single image input of a damaged vehicle
- 💸 Predicts repair cost based on damage severity (under development)
- 🧠 Custom-trained models for optimized accuracy
- 📊 Outputs bounding boxes, class labels, and estimated damage cost

## 🔍 How It Works

1. **Data Collection**  
   Labeled car images with bounding boxes and damage categories.

2. **Damage Detection**  
   - Model: YOLOv5
   - Output: Bounding boxes and class labels for damaged regions

3. **Cost Prediction** *(Work in progress)*  
   - Input: Cropped damage image / entire image
   - Model: CNN or regression model
   - Output: Estimated cost (in INR or USD)
